# Train-Section-Simulation
A Train Simulation System that helps in simulating trains between two stations.
The framework used is CodeIgniter which is a powerful framework when dealing with databases.

The Simulation System lets the user decide the stations between which he wants to run the trains.
The trains are fetched by the database and simulated by using SVG.
You can get the train details by hovering over the arrow.
The red arrow means the train has stopped at the station while the green arrow signifies a moving train.

The stacking up of the trains tells us that many trains are running on the same track.
It follows first cum first serve basis that is the train on the track has an earlier arrival time.

The Simulation Speed tells us how fast we want one minute to lapse in seconds.
